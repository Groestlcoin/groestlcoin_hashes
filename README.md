# Groestlcoin Hashes Library

This is a simple library which implements the hash functions needed by 
Groestlcoin. These are Groestl, SHA1, SHA256, SHA256d, and RIPEMD160. As an
ancilliary thing, it exposes hexadecimal serialization and deserialization,
since these are needed to display hashes anway.

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/bitcoin_hashes/)

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
This library should always compile with any combination of features on **Rust 1.22**.


## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, including additional hash function implementations.
